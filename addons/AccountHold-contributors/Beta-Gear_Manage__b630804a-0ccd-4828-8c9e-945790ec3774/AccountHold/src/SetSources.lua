-- RollupActivities is the ONLY de-duplication implementation in the add-on.
-- Epic 0002 (Armory build creator) and epic 0005 (Priorities) both call it, so
-- the two can never drift into two different answers to "what should I go do?".
--
-- Pure and side-effect free by contract: no SavedVariables, no events, no UI,
-- no Initialize. It reads one global table and returns new tables. That is what
-- makes it safe to call from a gamepad list refresh.
--
-- It also deliberately calls NO ZOS API except through AccountHold.L, so there
-- is nothing here to guard with type(x) == "function" and nothing that can be
-- missing on console.

-- Reading the database
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- A record is usable only if it has an activityKey: that string is the
-- de-duplication key, so a record without one cannot be grouped and would show
-- up as a nameless row. Dropping it makes the set read as "source unknown",

--
-- The database is read through the global on every call rather than captured at
-- load time. Load order is a manifest detail that has bitten this add-on
-- before, and it lets the harness swap in a fixture table without reloading the
-- module.
--
-- Contract A allows a single record OR an array of records; callers should
-- never have to care which, so both are normalized here.
--
-- The returned ARRAY is fresh, but the records inside it are the shared tables
-- from data/setSources.lua -- see the read-only note in that file. Copying them
-- per call would be worse, not better: a caller's edit would then silently
-- vanish on the next call instead of being visibly wrong.

--
-- Semantics, all of them deliberate:
--
-- * DE-DUPLICATION is by activityKey, never by display name. Two dungeons could
--   legitimately share a name across a rename; the key is the identity.
--
-- * MULTI-ACTIVITY SETS get the FULL outstanding count credited to EACH of
--   their activities, not a split share. The records say "this set drops here
--   AND here", so a player who needs 3 pieces needs 3 pieces whichever one they
--   run -- that is the number the row has to show, and it is what makes the two
--   activities rank as equally good options. Splitting (1.5 each) would rank a
--   two-source set BELOW a one-source set with the same need, which is exactly
--   backwards. Do not "fix" this into a split without re-reading this comment.
--
-- * A set contributes to a given activity AT MOST ONCE, even if it appears in
--   `wanted` twice or its record array lists the same activityKey twice.
--   `outstanding` is a property of the set ("pieces still missing"), not of the
--   row, so adding duplicates would inflate the ordering and mis-rank the plan.
--   First qualifying row wins.
--
-- * ROWS WITH outstanding <= 0 ARE SKIPPED ENTIRELY -- they contribute no count
--   and are not listed in setIds. An activity that survives therefore always
--   has real work behind it, which is what 0005 requires ("an activity with no
--   outstanding pieces disappears from the list"), and a fully-owned set never
--   appears in a row's setIds claiming to be covered.
--
-- * SETS WITH NO SOURCE all collapse into ONE synthetic entry
--   (activityKey = "unknown", activityType = "other"), with every unknown set
--   id collected on it. One honest row beats N rows that each say nothing.
--
-- * The SORT is outstanding DESC, then activityName ASC, then activityKey ASC.
--   The final tiebreaker is not decoration: table.sort is NOT stable, so
--   without a total order two equal-ranked activities could swap places between
--   repaints and the plan would look like it was shuffling itself. This add-on
--   has already been bitten by exactly that in its item sorting. activityKey is
--   unique per row here, so the comparator is a strict total order.
