-- DM2_ParseFightStats.lua — menu-first stats viewer (legacy overlay removed)
-- "DM2 Parse & Fight Stats" — capture, history, gamepad menu
--
-- Goals (v1):
--  • Track fight sessions (outgoing damage), store history (ring buffer, default 20)
--  • 2s rolling buckets to find top 2 spikes and bottom 2 dips
--  • Crit sustain overall + per spike/dip bucket
--  • Skill damage breakdown grid (amount, hits, avg hit, crit%, dps, dot/direct split)
--  • Buff uptime grid with source hints (Skill/Set/Self/External) for player's effects
--  • Light attack weaving readout using confirmed LA-hit rhythm and interval health
--  • Slash commands: /dm2stats, /dm2statsshow, /dm2statshide, /dm2statsclear
--
-- Notes:
--  • Set attribution (armor/weapon sets) is non-trivial; v1 focuses on skill/ability IDs.
--  • LAW uses server-confirmed light attack hit timing; skill timing remains approximate.
