Welcome, and Hail *NOR/!

Note: If you happened upon this Addon and are interested in joining one of the oldest guilds in existence, go to https://newoutriders.org/join and fill out our online application!

We are a casual, mature, family-friendly guild that has been around since 1992 when it was founded in the game The Shadow of Yserbius on the ImagiNation Network (INN). The guild has had a presence in over 30 online games in the past 30 years. The New Outriders (NOR) is active in several current games and have a dedicated group of enthusiastic players looking to grow the guild and experience all aspects of these games.

“To have fun and help others do the same” is the philosophy that guides us and we are looking for more friendly, mature members to enjoy the game with us. We have a mix of veteran members along with plenty of people who are brand new to the guild and gaming. Whether you are a long-time veteran looking to be around people who love the game as much as you do, or someone new and just playing the game for free, you are welcome to join us.

What we offer:

1. A rich history of tradition in greeting our members, celebrating their dedication in supporting guildmates with awards and promotion through the guild ranks.
2. The feel and experience of a guild having the oversight and support of a core group of long-time MMO veterans, led by the High Council.
3. Weekly ingame events.
4. Dedicated website with complete roster information, forums, event calendar, and more.

6. Support for other MMOs. The friends you make here in the *NOR/ realm you choose to play will be with you as you explore future games.

Is *NOR/ for you?

The kind of people we look for:

- Friendly, mature people (comfortable with a “PG” atmosphere) who fit within the principles that have served NOR well for decades. In brief, our principles are:
- Have fun!
- Help each other.
- Cooperate as a team.
- Service the greater good, group and guild.

How is the New Outriders different from other guilds?

1. NOR is an incorporated legal entity under 501c7.

Trial Team Rules:

In order to increase the speed, efficiency, and enjoyment of our raid teams, I am implementing the following rules for our fixed raid groups:

Timeliness:

There will be a sign-up sheet in the NOR ESO Discord Channel section for *NOR-ESO (#eso-trial-signups). We are counting on you to sign up in a timely manner and to remove yourself from the signup sheet if you cannot make it. Sometimes things come up suddenly, please do your best to let us know.

Each raid team member must show up no less that fifteen minutes before the raid. Make sure your equipment is in good repair, you have repair kits on hand, and you have any food buffs you think will help you in the fight.

If a member is not ready and hasn't notified us, we will start the process of a substitute starting 5 minutes before the raid. We want to begin these things on time as much as possible.

Remember, there are eleven other people counting on you.


Preparedness:

Every member will make sure to have the content unlocked before the raid and watch or read the appropriate guide. The raid time is for raiding, not for unlocking content. You have 6 other days during the week to unlock content. If someone needs help, there are plenty of people who can help. Contact me or the DMG if you need assistance with this.


Discord Communications:

Everyone on the raid team needs to be on Discord with, at minimum, the ability to listen. During the fights, callouts will be done by the raid leader or someone designated by the raid leader to assist with callouts. If tank swaps are necessary in the fight, the tanks will communicate with each other as well. Calm and professionally, not like someone just stuck an axe in your back. Also, during the combat phases, comms will be kept to a minimum so clear-as-possible instruction and callouts can be given.
___

 ]] },

 { name = "Trial Team Rules II", text = [[

In the event of a wipe, which happens often, between pulls is the time for the group to analyze what happened and talk about corrective actions. Everyone's opinion here is valuable and that is when we can have a group discussion on how to improve our performance.
Some things go without saying, but even with multiple wipes which can be frustrating, we will not take it out on other members of the group. Not in our tone, not in our language, not in our attitudes. We will be kind and polite and respectful at all times. We will keep the swearing down to an absolute minimum because stress and negativity breeds more stress and negativity. So, let's keep it NOR-like.

Also, Tanks are there to tank and they know this. Healers are there to heal and they are aware of this - that is why they are on that job. So, please don't yell out for tanks to taunt or healers to heal, they are well-aware.

In between pulls, we will together examine what went wrong and then the raid leader will offer suggestions in a polite, respectful way. Anyone constantly badgering another player and ordering someone else about will be dealt with swiftly.

Conclusion:

If we follow these basic rules, our raids should run very smoothly and everyone should enjoy them. If we do have trouble with a fight, we will beat it eventually. Most trials run an hour to an hour and a half if done by a team that knows the mechanics. Learning runs have a cap of two hours with several breaks during the run. If we stay organized we will do wonderfully.

Lord Garadian,
*NOR/LD-HC

Member Ranks and Non-Member Status:

Each member of NOR is assigned a rank, starting with Recruit until their induction into the guild as a full member at the rank of Squire. A Recruit is not officially a member of NOR until Squired. Members may thereafter advance in rank in accordance with their own merit and at the discretion of their officers.

All ranks enjoy mutual reciprocity on all Branches of NOR. This means one’s rank on one realm is the same as the rank on another with all of the attendant privileges and responsibilities. Length of time in rank are guidelines only and neither a guarantee or requirement.

The current ranks of NOR are, in ascending order:

1. Allies (AL)

The Allies is the non-member status in the New OutRiders. This status is for raiding friends, friends and family that may have joined a realm, but for many reasons have not become members.
If the Ally wears a NOR guild tag they must fill out a guild application.
Allies wearing a guild tag must follow the guild charter’s rules stated in the ‘Admission’ and ‘Jacket Creed’.
Allies may post on non-member sections of the forums and join members in VoIP channels.

2. Recruit (RT)

The recruitment time is a trial period for both the recruit to see if NOR is the guild for them and for the officers to be sure the new recruit is a good fit for the guild. Upon full admittance into the guild a recruit will move to the member rank of Squire.

Recruit Requirements:
An application must be filled out, confirming they have agreed to the guild’s charter.

Ceremonies & Oaths

Ceremonies are typically embellished for flair or entertainment value when appropriate. Officiants may add to the ceremony if they like, but they may not subtract any language.

1. Induction Ceremony (Squiring)

Also known as “Squiring” – this ceremony marks the acceptance of a candidate-recruit as a full member of NOR and is when they receive their “Jacket”:

“[Name], do you wish to become a member of NOR, yea or nay?”
Response: “Yea.”
“Very well, [Name], please come forward and kneel.”
“Do you promise to protect the weak and defend the innocent?”
“Do you swear to abide and uphold the Charter of the guild of the New OutRiders?”
“Recite the Jacket Creed after me:
I promise to wear the NOR name with pride. While wearing it, I will bring no shame or dishonor to NOR in word or deed. “I will defend it and anyone else who wears it to the uttermost limits of my ability.”
“And do you all here, bearing witness to these oaths, reaffirm your own fealty and promise to aid this member in the keeping of their vows?”
Response: “We do!”
[donate to the traditional ear bucket];
“Then by the power vested in me by … [Rank and Name of superior officer, if applicable] and … the High Council of NOR, I dub you Squire [Name];
“Arise Squire [Name] and be greeted by your guild.”;

2. Promotion Ceremony

The primary difference in this ceremony is the affirmation of the Jacket Creed rather than its full recitation.

“[Name], you are being offered a promotion to the rank of [Rank], do you accept, yea or nay?
Response: “Yea.”
“Very well, [Name], please come forward and kneel.”
“Do you promise to protect the weak and defend the innocent?”
“Do you swear to abide and uphold the Charter of the guild of the New OutRiders?”
“Do you reaffirm the Jacket Creed?”
(If Officer) Ask: “Do you swear to carry out the duties of your new rank?”
“And do you all here, bearing witness to these oaths, reaffirm your own fealty and promise to aid this member in the keeping of their vows?”
Response: “We do!”
[Mutilate the member in some grotesque fashion … again];
“Then, by the power vested in me by … [Rank and Name of superior officer, if applicable] and … the High Council of NOR, I hereby promote you to the rank of [Rank], with all of its attendant privileges and responsibilities;
“Arise [Rank][Name] and be greeted by your guild.”

Branches and Realms:

The High Council has complete discretion ordering sanctioned branches, regardless of game or platform. The organizational structure of NOR branches is as follows:

Active:

Active Open Realms are the most active games that New OutRiders members currently play. These branches of the guild actively recruit, run events, and have a structured hierarchy.

2. Have a member able to perform the duties of a Branch Leader.

Barony:

Four to six (4-6) members and one (1) officer, typically a Baron or higher.

County:

Eight to twelve (8-12) members and three (3) officers, two Barons and one Count.

Duchy:

Sixteen to twenty-four (16-24) members and seven (7) officers, four Barons, two Counts and one Duke or Duchess.
___

 ]] },

	{ name = "NOMAD and Provisional", text = [[

NOMAD:

NOMAD realms are places where the New OutRiders “jacket” guild name is used by our members. These branches have no recruiting or structured hierarchy.

Below are the expectations for use of the New Outriders name, be it a game on PC, Mobile or Console. These realms are for existing members to play together where NOR doesn’t currently have an active recruiting realm of play. Common examples of these realms are new games that have not yet become provisional branches due to being in alpha/beta, or previously active realms that have been closed that may have a remaining active members, and also games that may not have a guild structure option. The High Council needs to be aware of where the “New Outriders” name is being used due to the importance of the guild’s name and must follow the guild charter and philosophy.

1. NOMAD realms are designed for existing NOR members only.
2. No active Recruiting or expanding until the game becomes a provisional branch or HC is petitioned.
	a. Family and friends that are recruited gain the status of “Allies” and in some instances may become members per HC approval.
	b. Recruits that transfer to a NOMAD realm and are no longer active in a Active Realm of NOR become Allies status.
3. Active members in these games fall into our NOMAD realm.
4. The guild member(s) interested in creating a new NOR branch in an unofficial NOR realm must petition the High Council for permission to use the New OutRiders name and *NOR/ tag.
5. These branches do not require an active hierarchy, but must follow NOR policies and standards.
6. Provide information about the game that can be added to the NOMAD forum section
	a. Game name & website.
	b. Platform (console, mobile, pc).
	c. NORmember realm creator.
7. The realm creator notifies the HC when they are no longer playing the game.

Provisional:

A provisional realm is a new recruiting realm that is in its initial phase of becoming an active realm.
___

 ]] },

	{ name = "Creating a Branch", text = [[

Creating a Branch:

Any member, preferably an officer, may petition the High Council to open a new branch. That petition should take the following form:

1. A written request to the entire HC or a verbal request at an Open High Council Meeting, for the endorsement of a particular game as a new Branch of the guild; details should include:
a. List of members who have expressed an interest or who are currently playing, include their current rank and current realm if applicable.
b. Proposed CoC(Chain of Command).

2. All new branches are considered a provisional Barony.

The status of a branch may be upgraded by a vote of the High Council either of its own accord or at the request of the resident officers;
Upgrades continue to be provisional until voted by the High Council as an official Branch.
Official branches would ideally have a representative on the High Council; a Realm Leader.
___

 ]] },

	{ name = "Branch Leadership", text = [[

Leadership:

If the HC wishes to proceed in creating a branch, the HC will decide at a closed meeting who will head the branch.

This person must agree to do the following while in provisional status::

1. Attend ¾ of open HC meetings during the provisional period, to include all business meetings. Be prepared to discuss how your prospective branch is progressing.
2. Keep HC up to date on all branch issues.
3. Hold regularly scheduled meetings at least once every two weeks during the provisional period. Meet with officers regularly. All meetings should be scheduled, if short notice meetings will be held, notify the RL so he/she may attend if able. IF the game is not Free to Play (F2P), Officer meetings should be held in Discord and follow NOR meeting protocol, unless all present officers agree to an alternate method (I.E Voice chat).
4. Be in the game of the new branch as much as possible (check guild mail, PMs and NOR forums Daily).
5. Develop a Branch addendum to the NOR Standards and Convention that addresses any items in the new game not covered by current NOR documents. This addendum should provide guidance on any rule or content issues identified in the provisional petition. A draft of this document should be e-mailed to the HC and a finalized copy of this document must be presented to the HC and posted as a sticky on the forums or on the NOR Wiki, before the branch can be elevated to full Duchy.
6.Form a branch structure, in the new branch as discussed below. Keep all branch officers apprised of which members fall under them.
7. Transfer on permanent basis to the new branch
8.Ensure all new recruits sign up on the NOR web site and are listed on the online roster, prior to squiring. If a recruit is unable or unwilling to sign up on the web site, obtain the necessary information and manually add them to the roster – see your RL if you are not able to do so. All squired members of the branch should appear on the online roster. Keep a separate list of any recruits that have not signed up and include those numbers with your monthly business report.

The High Council assigns one of its members to act as Realm Leader (RL) in the new branch. The RL will advise the branch on NOR matters and offer assistance on in-game issues. During the provisional period, the RL must enter the game at least 1-2 times per week, attend at least 1 branch meeting per month and attend all officer meetings. (Game time and guild meetings are not required if the game is not Free to Play (F2P) and the RL is unable to obtain an account.) Assuming that the person selected by the HC to lead the branch accepts the job, an announcement of the new branch forming is made on all current realm bulletin boards, and on the *NOR home page.

 ]] },

	{ name = "New Branch Structure", text = [[

New Branch Structure:

A Branch is first formed as a Barony. It then grows into a County and finally a full-fledged Duchy. Until the new branch reaches Duchy status the Branch is considered provisional. Each month the HC is required to review the Branch status and determine if it is a functional part of *NOR/, should be expanded and continue to exist.

Guidelines (NOT GUARANTEES) for determining if a branch should be expanded:

1. County – At least 12 members, the Branch is at least one month old. All Counties should have one additional Baron(ess) for each six to eight (6-8) members with a minimum of one Baron(ess).

2. Duchy – At least 24 members, the Branch is at least two months old. All Duchies should have one additional Count(ess) for every three Barons with a minimum of one Count(ess).

	{ name = "Closed Realms", text = [[

Closed:

The Closed Realms are games that were previously active sanctioned games, but now no longer have any guild members playing.

Closing a Branch:

In order to be considered an active Realm, a branch must conform to the minimum Barony structure size and have an officer performing the role of Branch Leader. Once the branch has fallen below the Barony level or has no Branch Leader, it is time to consider closing or retiring it. Closing or Retiring is at the discretion of the HC.

Closed: When the HC is unable to maintain control of a realm and/or no one remains to play within the realm, the realm may close and disband the *NOR/ branch within that realm.

Retired: If the HC is able to maintain guild controls and some players still wish to carry the NOR Tag, a realm may be retired from active service and become a NOMAD realm.

Transfers:

Any member may transfer to another Branch of the guild. Inform the officers in both realms of your home game change so the guild roster can be updated.

Resignation:

The burden of ensuring continued membership rests solely with the member. Absent any concrete indication directly from the member, the Officers or HC may be forced to draw its own conclusions.

Members:

Members will typically be placed on MIA status unless overwhelming evidence to the contrary dictates otherwise.

Officers:

* It is the duty of Officers to make their intentions plain. *

1. An officer may resign their commission but remain in the guild (a voluntary demotion);
2. Explicitly communicating a resignation to another, higher ranked Officer or the guild at large by any means;
3. Detagging your Main on any Branch without prior notice and approval or “/ragequitting”. The Officer may have 24 hours to recant their action, but must suffer an automatic, mandatory demotion of one rank;
4. Refusing a re-tag subsequent to a detagging that was accidental or the result of administrative action, server maintenance, merger, migration or error on the part of the host server. Again, the Officer may have 24 hours (from first refusal) to recant their refusal and accept a retag or suffer demotion as in #2 above.

Reinstatement:

Former members may petition the High Council in writing via email or PM or in person at a High Council Meeting for re-admittance to NOR under any special circumstances, provisions, probation, demotions or conditions the HC deems fitting. (norhc@newoutriders.org)

Resolution of Misconduct:

Any member charged has two options available to them for the resolution of charges: Summary judgment by the charging Officer or a formal hearing before the High Council, but not both.

Hearing:

The member may request a hearing before the High Council.

2. Each member is limited to one Main guild name to be listed on the roster;
3. A member may not join another guild using their Main guild name on the same server or in any place where other guilds are in direct competition with NOR for members;
4. Members are permitted to make alternate characters or screen names that may be guild tagged. All tagged alts should be listed or noted by their Main with whatever means is available by the ingame mechanics;
5. Alts may also be listed on the guild roster;
6. Each alternate character will obtain the approval an officer before being tagged;
7. Any alternate character that is inadvertently de-tagged from NOR may be re-tagged without delay;
8.Any changes to your Main name requires prior approval;

Hailing:

A greeting of “Hail *NOR/” should be given to your guildmates upon entering any host. Custom urges one include your main NOR name in the Hail if you are on an Alt.

Forums/Discord:

We encourage members to participate in all aspects of guild life, in particular the forums. This has been the primary means of communication between members for many years.

Grouping:

When grouping with fellow members of NOR or playing at-large in the game please take care to show courtesy and grace. When in doubt, one may fall back on virtually any lesson acquired in Kindergarten: Wait your turn, share, etc.

Recruiting:

It is the duty of all members of NOR to recruit. It is also the least savory or gives members the greatest difficulty. As a rule, you need not actively stump for NOR recruiting. As a member, you are an ambassador of NOR to other players by your presence and attitude. Usually, that is sufficient to generate interest. Do not actively “poach” players from other guilds; This does not apply if you are approached by the player. When in doubt, consult a superior;

Events:

It is considered good form and common courtesy to attend guild events. This applies to in-game events, GLUEs and HC meetings. These are not compulsory, unless mandated by your rank, but we encourage members to attend as many as they can reasonably manage.

Real World Topics:

Part of the ongoing harmony and unity in the guild comes from avoiding even the most ordinary real world topics. The idea is to provide an escape from the Real World, not bring its many issues and conflicts into the guild.

Privacy:

Member confidence should be jealously guarded and one should err on the side of caution. You may become privy to personal or confidential information about another member that is not appropriate for public disclosure. Disclose nothing that is not readily available to the public through normal play or use of the games we participate in.
