-- Under Pressure -- Settings.lua
-- =============================================================================
-- LibHarvensAddonSettings panel. Ported from LibAddonMenu-2.0 in 0.3.3.
--
-- WHY LHAS. LAM does resolve on the Bethesda.net console catalogue, but its
-- console support is a partial auto-conversion INTO LibHarvensAddonSettings,
-- and not every control type survives that translation. Depending on LHAS
-- directly removes the conversion layer rather than adding a dependency.
--
-- NO NIL-GUARD, BY DESIGN. LHAS is a hard "## DependsOn", exposed as the plain
-- global LibHarvensAddonSettings (no LibStub, and it must never be vendored).
-- If it is missing the game disables this addon before any of our code runs, so
-- a fallback branch here could only ever be dead code -- and dead code that
-- claims to handle a case it cannot reach is worse than none. The LAM version
-- of this file carried exactly such a branch, complete with a comment
-- describing a manifest directive the manifest did not use.
--
-- CONSOLE LAYOUT. LHAS turns every ST_SECTION into a navigable sub-menu row, so
-- the top-level screen for this addon is FIVE arrow rows and every actual
-- control lives one level down. Two consequences drove the copy below:
--
--   * The screen header keeps showing the ADDON name/version/author on those
--     sub-pages -- the section name is NOT redisplayed anywhere. So each label
--     has to make sense without its section for context. That is why the six
--     time sliders carry unit = "s" and the two offsets carry unit = "px": the
--     "(seconds)" in the section title is invisible from the page it titles.
--   * A row with no tooltip blanks the whole left tooltip quadrant when it is
--     selected. Under LAM a missing tooltip was a missing nicety; here it reads
--     as broken next to its neighbours. Every selectable row has one.
--
-- Reset to Defaults is worth knowing about and is not configurable: the keybind
-- only appears once you are INSIDE a section (the top-level list holds no
-- control with a `default`), but it resets ALL sections when pressed.

-- Resolved in Init(), not here. `## DependsOn` does guarantee the library is

-- drift apart. Keep in sync with DEFAULT_SAVED in UnderPressure.lua.

-- Tunable access is split read/write. The LAM version used a single tun()
-- accessor that invalidated the engine's tunables cache on BOTH paths,
-- justified by "getFunc only runs while the panel is open" -- a claim about the
-- settings library, and porting the settings library is exactly when such a
-- premise stops holding silently. LHAS re-runs every control's getFunction on
-- panel show, and would re-run all of them on every slider STEP if allowRefresh
-- were enabled.
--
-- The property that motivated the single accessor -- no individual setter can
-- forget to invalidate -- is preserved and strengthened: the write IS the
-- invalidation, so there is no longer an order to get wrong.
