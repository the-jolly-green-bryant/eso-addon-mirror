-- GetUnitRawWorldPosition update every tick, or does it step at a lower
-- network tick rate while the engine interpolates the companion's rendered
-- body smoothly? A 5Hz sampler aliases a 10Hz staircase into a perfectly
-- clean-looking ramp -- which is exactly what the 2026-08-08 sample showed,
-- so that sample cannot distinguish the two cases. This one samples at the
-- real poll rate and reports how often the raw value didn't change at all
-- between ticks, which tells the two apart directly. Buffered rather than
-- logged live: 30 chat writes at 30Hz would both flood the window and
