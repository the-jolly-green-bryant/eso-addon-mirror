--- Can either use unpack to assign it to local variables:
--- local time, formattedTime, count, level, tag, message, trace = unpack(entry)
--- or use the lib.ENTRY_*_INDEX constants to access individual values directly:
--- local message = entry[lib.ENTRY_MESSAGE_INDEX]
--- @param wasDuplicate - true if the same message was logged more than once.
--- In which case only the time is updated and the occurrences count increased by one
