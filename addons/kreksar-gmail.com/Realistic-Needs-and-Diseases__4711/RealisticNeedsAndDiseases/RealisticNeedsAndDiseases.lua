-- Stack-size SNAPSHOT comparison, not the stackCountChange parameter. The

-- suggesting that parameter doesn't behave the way it was assumed to here.
--
-- Buff-gained CONFIRMATION gate, layered on top of the inventory stack
-- tracking below — this is the actual fix, ported from a real working
-- pattern (not guessed): listening for EVENT_EFFECT_CHANGED and checking
-- LibFoodDrinkBuff:IsAbilityAFoodOrDrinkBuff(abilityId) tells you reliably
-- that the player just ACTUALLY ATE/DRANK something (ESO grants a real buff
-- effect for it), as opposed to an inventory change from selling, trading,
-- depositing, or some other non-consumption removal. The inventory-slot
-- tracking below still does the job of identifying WHICH item was consumed
-- (the buff event alone doesn't say that) — but is only trusted as a real
-- consumption when it happens within BUFF_APPLICATION_WINDOW ms of a
-- confirmed buff-gain. This is why LibFoodDrinkBuff is now a REQUIRED
-- dependency rather than optional — there's no reliable fallback for this
-- specific confirmation signal.
--
-- BIDIRECTIONAL: ESO does not guarantee EVENT_EFFECT_CHANGED (buff granted)
-- and EVENT_INVENTORY_SINGLE_SLOT_UPDATE (stack shrinks) fire in a fixed
-- order relative to each other. The original check only looked BACKWARD
-- (was a buff granted recently, as of the inventory event?), so whenever
-- the inventory event happened to be processed first, the buff timestamp
-- wasn't set yet, the gate rejected a genuine consumption, and that
-- restore was silently lost — no error, no trace, just a drink that
-- "didn't work." _pendingConsumption below covers the other direction: if
-- the inventory shrink arrives with no recent buff, it's held (not
-- dropped) for BUFF_APPLICATION_WINDOW_MS so a buff event that arrives
-- shortly AFTER can still credit it retroactively.

-- fields added to `needs` across rapid iteration (e.g. `drunkenness`) are never
-- back-filled into an existing save. Worse, if `sv.needs` is somehow absent or
-- nil in the on-disk data, ZO_SavedVars replaces it with the entire defaults
-- sub-table object — resetting hunger/thirst/fatigue to 100 — which is exactly
-- the bug that caused needs to reset to full on every login.
