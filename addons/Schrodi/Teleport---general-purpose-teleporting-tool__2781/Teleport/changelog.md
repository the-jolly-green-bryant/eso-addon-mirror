### 1.0.15
- added Galen zone (yes, finally applies here as well)
- added a new feature - travel to a reset instance 
`rDungeonAlias`, similar to previously available `nDungeonAlias` or `vDungeonAlias`, ie.

- `rCA` - reset instance of Coral Aerie
- `vSS` - veteran Sunspire
Resets the instance or assumes that instance was already reset by a group leader. 
This is always a paid teleport. Same as with other paid teleports, you can 
mitigate the cost by having a wayshrine menu open.
