--
-- IMPORTANT - why this is NOT a timer loop:
-- RequestMoveItem is a PROTECTED function. It must be called via
-- CallSecureProtected AND from a hardware-event callstack (a button click) -- it
-- does NOT work from a RegisterForUpdate timer or an event handler (their
-- callstacks are untrusted). So every move is issued synchronously, inside the
-- click handler that calls StartRun. One call per job moves that job's full
-- quantity; the engine spreads any overflow beyond 200 across backpack slots
-- itself, so there is no per-stack loop.
--
-- The arrival of the moved items is asynchronous, so the (honest) progress bar
-- is advanced by listening to EVENT_INVENTORY_SINGLE_SLOT_UPDATE on the backpack
-- (stack-count increases) until the requested total has landed, then the run
-- finishes. The listener is the only thing that outlives the click, and it is
