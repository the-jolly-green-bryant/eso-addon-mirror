-- ZoomReconciler.lua
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Single owner of "where should the camera converge after an FPV toggle we
-- handle ourselves".
--
-- The addon pre-hooks ToggleGameCameraFirstPerson. In states where the engine
-- would refuse a proper third-person/FPV transition (mounted, werewolf,
-- swimming) -- or when leaving FPV -- BAV takes ownership and drives the camera
-- distance itself. The hard part is that other addons (notably PvpAlerts /
-- Miat's PvP) call ToggleGameCameraFirstPerson() TWICE in one rendered frame to
-- probe the camera, expecting the pair to net to zero visible change.
--
-- The old approach tried to RECOGNISE such a pair by frame timestamp and undo
-- our zoom synchronously on the second call. That heuristic was fragile: it
-- broke differently in Cyrodiil (oscillation), as a werewolf (stuck FPV after a
-- port), and on the world map (forced FPV) -- one bug per state, because the
-- "two calls share a frame" assumption does not hold everywhere.
--
-- Model here: INTENT + COALESCING DEFERRED RECONCILE. We never inspect frame
-- timing. An owned toggle only FLIPS a persistent `desiredZoom` intent relative
-- to its OWN value (FPV <-> third person) and schedules a single next-frame
-- reconcile that writes `desiredZoom` exactly once. A probe pair is two flips,
-- so `desiredZoom` returns to where it started and the one reconcile writes the
-- original value -- net zero, regardless of whether the two probes shared a
-- frame. If the engine rejects the write (a state that owns its own distance),
-- we retry a bounded number of times rather than leaving the camera half-moved.
--
-- Scope is deliberately NARROW: this only engages where BAV already blocks the
-- engine (limited state, or leaving FPV). The normal third-person->FPV path is
-- left as a passthrough so the engine runs its native transition and other
-- addons can still measure the ordinary case -- HandleToggle returns false there
-- and the hook lets the original function run.
--
-- Nothing here touches SavedVariables directly; it routes verified writes
-- through the main file's SetCameraZoom (which owns the write-failure metric)
-- and persistence through QueueSave.
