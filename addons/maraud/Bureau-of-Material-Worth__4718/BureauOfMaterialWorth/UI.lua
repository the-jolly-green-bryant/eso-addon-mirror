-- Shared visual language
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Three surfaces are drawn by this addon: the summary panel beside the Craft Bag
-- (Window.lua), the material table (DetailWindow.lua) and the withdraw window
-- (WithdrawDialog.lua). Each one used to carry its own copy of the chrome --
-- backdrop tint, border colour, divider alpha, title font, row-hover wash -- and
-- those copies had drifted: three different background opacities, two different
-- tooltip title fonts, dividers at one weight in one file and another elsewhere,
-- and every tooltip line colour hand-written as a normalized RGB triple that no
-- longer matched the hex palette it was converted from.
--
-- This module is the single source of truth for all of it. It holds the design
-- tokens (colour, type scale, spacing, chrome) and the small builders that apply
-- them, so a window file describes WHAT it is drawing and never re-decides HOW
-- the addon looks. Changing a token here restyles every window at once.
--
-- Loaded after the core (it reads private.COLOR_*) and before the window files.

-- Colour
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The palette itself stays in the core as hex strings, because most of the
-- addon's colouring happens inside text via inline |c codes. Controls, however,
-- are tinted with normalized RGB components. Converting here -- rather than
-- writing the triples out by hand at each call site -- is what keeps a control's
-- tint and a label's |c code the same colour, which is exactly what had drifted.

-- these instead of naming a ZoFont directly, so the three windows share one
-- rhythm and a change of scale is a change in one table.
