-- PB's ChatAssistant
-- Author: PinkBanther

-- On console the chat entry box can only be opened from the controller -- Options + touchpad on
-- PS5 -- and opening it is what makes the platform put its own text input screen up, the IME
-- included. With a USB keyboard plugged into the console that means letting go of the keyboard
-- and reaching for the pad before every single message.
--
-- Press Enter, the box opens, the console's input screen comes up. That is the whole add-on.

-- ROUTES
--
-- Two ways exist for a key press to reach add-on Lua, and on console only one of them works:
--
--   binding  Bindings.xml declares PBSCHATASSISTANT_START_CHAT and the player binds a key to it.
--            This is the sanctioned route and the only one on PC. On console it is dead:
--            AreKeyboardBindingsSupportedInGamepadUI() returns false, meaning the client does
--            not route keyboard keys into the binding system at all. The action is still
--            declared, because it costs nothing and is the right route wherever it does work.
--
--   catcher  A TopLevelControl with keyboardEnabled="true" and an OnKeyDown handler, kept shown
--            so it is handed key events. The game uses this pattern itself on a console-only
--            screen (ZO_ControllerDisconnect).
--
--            Measured on PS5: the default tier receives keyboard keys. Enter arrives as key 3
--            with IsKeyCodeKeyboardKey() true. The HIGH tier was not needed and is kept only as
--            the fallback to probe if a client update ever moves this.
--
-- captureMode: "auto", "off", "default" or "high".
--
-- It ships OFF, and that is not caution -- a shown catcher was observed to stop the controller
-- responding on PS5, from the moment the add-on loaded and before any key was pressed. Gamepad
-- buttons travel as KeyCodes through the same handler as keyboard keys, so the working theory is
-- that the catcher is swallowing them. Until that is settled the add-on loads doing nothing, and
-- /pbchat probe is how the swallowing gets measured: it reports gamepad and keyboard keys apart,
-- and clears itself after 15 seconds.
--
-- Auto, when chosen explicitly, picks the catcher exactly when the binding route is dead.

	--
	-- A shown catcher pauses the gamepad buttons, Options among them. Shipping "default" armed
	-- the catcher at load, so a fresh install began with the Options button dead -- and with the
	-- usual way out of that (open chat, let the input screen disarm the catcher) behind the very
	-- button that was not working. It only ever reached new installs: anyone who had used the
	-- add-on already had "off" written to their saved settings by autoSafe.
	--
	-- Off costs nothing that matters. The focus watcher is what raises the input screen, it is
	-- always on, and it serves a chat window opened from the controller exactly as well. Only the
	-- Enter key needs arming, and arming it is a deliberate act: /pbchat enter.
	--
	-- followInput false: the input-type event gated the catcher in an earlier build and was the
	-- wrong signal for it. It fires on a CHANGE only, so it cannot cover a run of key presses,
	-- and gating on it left nothing listening. /pbchat follow on still exists.

-- Opening the box
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- WHY StartChatInput() IS NOT USED
--
-- It is what the game's own Start Chat binding calls, and it is closed to add-ons on console.
-- It reaches ZO_GamepadChatSystem:StartTextEntry(), which calls the private SetSetting() to
-- persist the chat HUD setting, and a *private* function cannot be called by add-on code at all.
-- The hardware-event rule that lets a keybind reach a *protected* function does not extend to
-- private ones: calling it straight out of OnKeyDown fails exactly as calling it from a timer
-- did, with "Attempt to access a private function 'SetSetting' from insecure code".
--
-- The private call sits behind `if not dontShowHUDWindow`, so passing that flag is the only way
-- an add-on can open the box at all. The flag also skips the work that puts the window on
-- screen, which has to be done here instead -- and it matters that it is done, because a focused
-- entry box with no window activates an input eater (DIRECTIONAL_INPUT:ConsumeAll) and pushes
-- the GamepadChatSystem action layer, leaving nothing on screen to dismiss. StartStuckWatchdog
-- undoes that state if it ever happens anyway.
--
-- Everything below is plain Lua on the chat system. None of it is private or protected.
local function OpenChatEntry()
	local chat = GetChatSystem()
	if not chat or type(chat.StartTextEntry) ~= "function" then

-- WHY THE WAIT IS BACK, AND WHY IT IS THE POINT
--
-- The console's input screen -- the IME -- is what makes any of this worth having, and it does
-- not come up when the box is opened in the same frame as the key press. Measured on PS5:
--
--   open immediately   entry open true, edit focus true, input screen FALSE
--   open 5s later      input screen appears
--
-- The input device is not what decides it. The second measurement was repeated without touching
-- the controller at all and the screen still came up, which rules out the platform gating this
-- on whether the player last used a gamepad.
--
-- What it is, is that the key press arrives while the previous focus state is still unwinding --
-- the chat box closing on the Enter that submitted the last message, say. Reopening in that same
-- frame gives the platform no lost-and-regained focus to react to. Let the frame finish and the
-- focus is genuinely fresh, so the screen is raised.
--
-- Which makes the wait the mechanism rather than a safety margin, exactly as first specified.
-- Deferring is free now, too: nothing left on the open path is private, so there is no hardware
-- event trace to preserve.

	-- THE ROUTE.
	--
	-- Not the key catcher. A catcher does receive the keyboard's Enter, but every tier tried on
	-- PS5 kills the gamepad buttons for as long as one is shown. It stays in the add-on behind
	-- /pbchat capture, for probing and for any platform where it is harmless, and ships off.
	--
	-- Two routes, each covering what the other cannot.
	--
	-- The event fires on PS5 -- confirmed, with nothing shown at all, a keyboard key after
	-- controller use opened the box and brought the input screen up. Its limit is in the name: it
	-- reports a CHANGE, so the second key press in a row fires nothing, which is exactly why an
	-- event-only build worked once and then went quiet.
	--
	-- The catcher has the opposite shape. It sees every key press, and it takes the gamepad
	-- buttons for as long as it is shown.
	--
	-- So the event decides when the catcher is up. Touch the keyboard: the switch opens the box
	-- and raises the catcher, which then handles every key after it. Touch the controller: the
	-- switch puts the catcher away and the buttons come back. Stop typing for idleSeconds and it
	-- comes down on its own, in case no controller event ever arrives.
	--
	-- The cost is that the buttons are dead while the player is at the keyboard, and that the
	-- first key of a session opens the box whatever key it was. /pbchat follow off and
	-- /pbchat trigger off turn those two off separately.
