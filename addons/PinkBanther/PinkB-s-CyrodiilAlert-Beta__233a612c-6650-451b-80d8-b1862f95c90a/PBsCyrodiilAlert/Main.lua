-- PB's CyrodiilAlert
-- Author: PinkBanther
--
-- Your alliance's keeps, in your chat window, the moment someone starts hitting one.
--
-- Cyrodiil already tells you a keep is under attack -- but only on the campaign map, as a
-- crossed-swords pin you have to open the map to see. If you are riding, farming a resource or
-- fighting somewhere else, the siege that takes your home keep happens in silence. This
-- add-on reads that same pin data on a timer and says it in chat, in colour:
--
--     red     a holding of yours has come under attack, and again while it lasts
--     blue    the attack is over and the holding is still yours -- defended
--     yellow  the holding changed hands -- lost
--
-- and, if you switch it on, the same watch pointed the other way:
--
--     green   a fight has started at a holding another alliance owns
--     blue    that holding is now yours -- taken
--
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- WHERE THE INFORMATION COMES FROM
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
-- Five public functions, the same ones the client's own map uses in
-- esoui/ingame/map/worldmap.lua (RefreshKeeps) and esoui/ingame/map/cmaphandlers.lua
-- (CMapHandlers:RefreshKeeps):
--
--     GetNumKeeps()                                 how many holdings the client knows
--     GetKeepKeysByIndex(index)  -> keepId, bgContext
--     GetKeepType(keepId)        -> KEEPTYPE_*
--     GetKeepAlliance(keepId, bgContext)  -> ALLIANCE_*      who owns it
--     GetKeepUnderAttack(keepId, bgContext) -> bool          the crossed swords
--
-- All five are reads of state the client already holds. Nothing here asks the server for
-- anything, nothing here writes anything, and taking the add-on out leaves no trace.
--
-- bgContext is the campaign the row belongs to: the client reports the same keep once for the
-- campaign you are standing in and once for the campaign you are homed to. IsLocalBattleground-
-- Context(bgContext) is the client's own test for "this is the campaign in front of you", and
-- cmaphandlers.lua uses exactly that to decide which keeps to pin. This add-on uses it to
-- decide which keeps to watch, so what it alerts on is what the map in front of you draws.
--
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- WHY A TIMER AND NOT THE EVENT
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
-- EVENT_KEEP_UNDER_ATTACK_CHANGED exists and fires with (keepId, bgContext, underAttack). A
-- timer was asked for, and a timer is what this is -- but the choice is not a compromise:
--
--   * the interval is a setting, so how noisy the add-on can get is a number you control
--     rather than whatever the server sends;
--   * a poll cannot miss an edge. If an event is dropped while zoning, or arrives before the
--     add-on registered, the next pass still sees the true state and corrects itself;
--   * "still under attack after a minute" is a question about now, not about an edge, and it
--     has to be asked on a timer whatever the first alert came from.
--
-- The cost is nothing worth measuring: one pass reads a few dozen values already in memory.
-- The only thing given up is sub-interval latency -- at the default five seconds, an alert is
-- at most five seconds late.
--
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- THE STATE MACHINE
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
-- One entry per watched holding, created when it first comes under attack and dropped when the
-- attack is over. The entry remembers whose the holding was when it was created, and everything
-- the add-on says is a transition of that entry:
--
--     no entry  + mine + attacked        -> RED, entry created
--     entry     + mine + attacked        -> RED again, once per repeat interval
--     entry     + mine + not attacked    -> BLUE, entry dropped         (held)
--     entry     + mine -> not mine       -> YELLOW, entry dropped       (lost)
--
--     no entry  + theirs + attacked      -> GREEN, entry created        (offense, optional)
--     entry     + theirs + attacked      -> GREEN again, once per repeat interval
--     entry     + theirs -> mine         -> BLUE, entry dropped         (taken)
--     entry     + theirs + not attacked  -> entry dropped, nothing said
--
-- The endings that change hands are read off the owning alliance, not off the attack flag,
-- because a keep that has just flipped usually stays under attack -- the side that lost it is
-- already hitting it back. Ownership is what decides which ending it was.
--
-- The last line is the one asymmetry, and it is deliberate: a fight at somebody else's holding
-- that ends with that holding still theirs has changed nothing about your campaign, and a line
-- saying so is a line you learn to scroll past.
--
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- WHO IS ATTACKING -- WHAT THE CLIENT WILL AND WILL NOT SAY
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
-- GetKeepUnderAttack is a bare yes/no. There is no "attacking alliance" anywhere in the keep
-- API, and in a three-way campaign a fight at an enemy keep is as likely to be the third
-- alliance's as yours. So the green line says "a fight has started there" -- which is what is
-- actually known -- and never claims your side started it.
--
-- The one piece of evidence that bears on it is GetNumSieges(keepId, bgContext, alliance),
-- which the client's own keep tooltip uses (keeptooltip.lua:163) to show each alliance's siege
-- count. Your own alliance having siege standing at a holding it does not own is a push of
-- yours. It is evidence, not proof -- an attack does not need siege at all -- so it is reported
-- as the count it is, appended to the line, rather than rewritten into a claim. It is gated on
-- DoesKeepTypeHaveSiegeLimit, exactly as the tooltip gates it: a resource has no siege count.
--
-- Whether that count is live for a keep on the other side of the map is the one thing here
-- that has to be measured rather than read: /pbalert list prints it for every holding.
--
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- WHAT IT DOES WHEN IT IS NOT SURE
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
-- It says nothing. There is no state in which this add-on guesses out loud:
--
--   * keep API missing on this client            -> the timer never starts, /pbalert says so
--   * outside an AvA zone                        -> the pass is skipped and the watch cleared,
--                                                   so coming back re-reads reality
--   * a holding that drops out of the keep list  -> its entry is dropped without an ending,
--     (campaign change, zoning)                     because there is nothing left to report on
--   * who is attacking an enemy holding          -> not claimed; the siege count is shown
--   * a name the client will not give            -> printed as its keep id rather than blank
--
-- The one thing worth knowing: the clock on an alert starts when the add-on first SAW the
-- attack, not when the attack began. Zone in on a siege already in progress and "3:20 so far"
-- means three minutes twenty of watching, not of siege.

-- what identifies it.
--
-- A message printed at EVENT_ADD_ON_LOADED is thrown away because chat is not up yet, so

-- GetCampaignAllianceScore -- so the numbers are the campaign's numbers rather than a private
-- count that could disagree with the map.
--
-- What is NOT the client's is the "under attack" column: that is counted off this add-on's own
-- pass, because there is no API that answers "how many of this alliance's holdings are being
-- fought over". It is the column that says where the campaign actually is right now, which is
-- the reason to have the summary on screen rather than opening the map.
--
-- Everything degrades one column at a time. No campaign (you are not in one, or the client has

-- one each time it opens.
