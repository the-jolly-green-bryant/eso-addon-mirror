--                  game has a back row of its own (ZO_ActionBarTimer, the "back row" and
--                  "action bar timers" settings), but it only appears for the one slot whose
--                  effect is still running, and only while it is running. This one is always
--                  there, so both sets can be read at a glance.
--   the text       how long is left on each ability's effect, and how many targets are under
--                  it, on both bars.
--
-- Where the numbers come from:
--
--   GetActionSlotEffectTimeRemaining(slot, hotbarCategory)   -- ms, and it answers for the bar
--   GetActionSlotEffectDuration(slot, hotbarCategory)        --   you are NOT on as well
--   GetActionSlotEffectStackCount(slot, hotbarCategory)
--

-- HandleSlotEffectUpdated), and they are the whole countdown: no guessing which effect came
-- from which cast, which is what makes an add-on like Action Duration Reminder two thousand
-- lines long. The one thing they do not answer is how many targets an effect is on, and there
-- is no API that does, so that part is counted here from EVENT_EFFECT_CHANGED -- see
-- "Counting targets".
--
-- Nothing of the client's is hooked or called. The labels and the back row are controls of our
-- own, built from the templates in Controls.xml and parented to the button they belong to, so
-- the action bar's own fragment fades and hides them with the bar.

-- Which effect a slot's countdown is for
--
-- One slot can have more than one effect of the player's own running at once, and the client
-- answers with a single number. Blue Betty is the example that came back from a PS5: the netch
-- grants its buff for 22 seconds and does something of its own every 5, and the countdown ran
-- 22, 21, ... and then, a few seconds from the end, started again at 5. That is the client
-- handing over to whichever effect has the longer left.
--
-- Read straight, that is what an add-on shows. What a player wants is the ability's own effect,
-- counted to the end, so a reading whose duration is much shorter than the one already running
-- is not taken while that one still has time on it. It is picked up the moment the longer one
-- ends, so a genuinely short effect on its own is still shown.
--
-- Everything on the icon comes through here -- the countdown, the shade and how long the target
-- count is held -- so the three cannot disagree.
