--
-- Moves and resizes the player's health, magicka and stamina bars on the HUD.
--
-- The three bars are three sibling controls -- ZO_PlayerAttributeHealth, ...Magicka and
-- ...Stamina -- inside one top-level, ZO_PlayerAttribute, and the game gives the player no say
-- in any of it. The top-level is pinned to the bottom of the screen (BOTTOM of GuiRoot, 105 up,
-- 64 high: ZO_PlayerAttribute_Gamepad_Template) and is as wide as the screen allows
-- (ResizeToFitScreen, clamped to 1014-1600); health sits at its centre, magicka's right edge 237
-- in from its left, stamina's left edge 237 in from its right. Nothing else.
--
-- What this add-on writes, and why it is safe to write (full evidence in FINDINGS.md):
--
--   position   the anchor of each of the three containers: CENTER of the bar on BOTTOM of
--              GuiRoot, so the position is sideways from the middle of the screen and up from
--              the bottom edge. Anchoring to GuiRoot rather than to the group is what lets the
--              three be placed apart from each other; the containers stay children of
--              ZO_PlayerAttribute, so the HUD fragment still fades and hides them as before.
--   size       the scale of each container, 50% to 200%. Scale rather than SetDimensions,
--              because the width of these containers is not ours: ZO_UnitVisualizer_ShrinkExpand
--              writes 237 / 323 / 141 onto them, and animates between those, every time a buff
--              or debuff changes a maximum. Scale is never touched by the client, and it takes
--              the frame, the background, the bar and the numbers with it in proportion.
--
-- The werewolf, mount stamina and siege health bars are anchored to magicka, stamina and health
-- respectively, so they follow on their own; they are given the same scale as the bar they
-- belong to so the pair still lines up.
--
-- Both are writes to controls. Nothing in the attribute bars is hooked or wrapped, and none of
-- their code is called: the rule from PB's MailerExtension, measured on PS5, is that a client
-- closure created while an add-on frame is on the stack is permanently untrusted. These
-- controls run combat code -- power updates, the attribute visualiser, the warners -- on every
-- frame of a fight, which is the last place to leave one.
--
-- Nothing is written while the settings still equal the game's own. Each bar's place is measured
-- off the control before the first write, so "untouched" is not a guess: an installed-but-unset
-- add-on is indistinguishable from not having it.

-- The three attribute bars are container controls with a companion each: the small bar the game
-- anchors to them and shows in their place (werewolf over magicka, mount stamina under stamina,
-- siege health under health). The companion keeps its own anchor -- it is relative to the bar,
-- so it moves with it -- and is given the same scale, or the pair would no longer meet.
--
-- The skill bar is the action bar's top-level, ZO_ActionBar1. Every button, the ultimate, the
-- quickslot and the weapon swap marker are anchored inside it, so its anchor and scale are the
-- whole bar's. normalWidth is what the control is when the game has just laid it out; a
-- measurement is only taken while it reads that (see CaptureGame).
