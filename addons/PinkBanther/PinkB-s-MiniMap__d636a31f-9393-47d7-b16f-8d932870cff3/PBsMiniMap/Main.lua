-- PB's MiniMap
-- Author: PinkBanther
--
-- Based on "Votan's Minimap" by votan (https://www.esoui.com/downloads/info1399-VotansMinimap.html),
-- with thanks. The original idea -- reuse the game's own world map as a minimap rather than
-- drawing a second one -- is votan's, and much of the map handling here still comes from it.
--
-- This version is reworked for console (PS5/Xbox Series), where all add-ons share a 100MB
-- memory pool. The original's InitMiniMap layer exhausts that pool as soon as the standard
-- map is zoomed out to all of Tamriel, so the default configuration here (init level 2) skips
-- it entirely and instead parks the game's own map window on the HUD at a chosen size and
-- position, handing it straight back when the full map is opened.

-- Display name is a Lua constant, the version comes from the manifest.
--
-- The name is NOT taken from the manifest "## Title" line: reading it back produced a mangled
-- heading in the settings panel (the "PB's " prefix was lost), so the exact string is pinned
-- here where nothing else can rewrite it. The version is still read from the manifest, so a
-- release only means editing "## Title" and "## Version" there -- no Lua change.
--
--   addon.baseTitle  "PB's MiniMap"        -> sub-panel headings
--   addon.version    "1.0.3"               -> version field in the settings panel
--   addon.title      "PB's MiniMap 1.0.3"  -> settings panel heading
-- Typographic apostrophe (U+2019), not ASCII '.
--
-- With the ASCII one the settings panel rendered the name as "MINIMAP 1.4.2": the "PB's "
-- prefix was being eaten somewhere in the settings library's string handling. U+2019 is not
-- a quoting character to any of that, and it is what was asked for in the first place.

-- in the world (plus the housing/collectible data behind them) before culling them down to
-- the priority wayshrines. Charged to the add-on pool, that single step blows the limit.

-- The API list shows a proper setter for this; assigning the field directly was a guess at
-- its name and had no effect, which is part of why the view still clamped to the map edge.
-- Clearing the place-name labels.
--
-- Nothing clears the location pins any more.
--
-- Hiding place names used to release the location pin pool and RemovePins("loc") along with
-- it, which does not hide names so much as delete the pins that carry them -- and the marker
-- goes with the name. That is why the merchant and service icons the standard map shows were
-- missing from the minimap: they were being thrown away to get rid of the text on them.
--
-- HideMapAreaLabels is what actually hides the names. It hides the Label child of each pin
-- and leaves the pin itself alone, which is the whole job. (An early attempt went after the
-- ZO_MapLocationPins_Manager labels instead and changed nothing, which is how the deletion
-- came to be here in the first place.)
--
-- The instance is still captured from RefreshLocations: RefreshMapLocationLabels uses it to
-- have the game rebuild the pins when the standard map comes forward, so the names we hid one
-- by one come back without us having to work out which ones it wanted.

-- Place names attached to pins.
--
-- These are the Label child of each ZO_MapPin, not the ZO_MapLocationPins_Manager labels the
-- first attempt went after -- which is why hiding those changed nothing. The game decides per
-- pin and per zoom whether a label shows, so rather than trying to predict that, walk the live
-- pins and hide what is showing.
--
-- Only ever hides. Unhiding selectively would mean guessing which labels the game wanted
-- visible; instead the standard map gets a refresh, which rebuilds the pins with the game's
-- own choices.
-- Zone name above the minimap.
--
-- A control of our own rather than ZO_WorldMapTitle: that one belongs to the map window and
-- is driven by InitMiniMap, which the lite path skips. It is also parented to GuiRoot rather
-- than to ZO_WorldMap, so the opacity setting does not fade the text along with the map, and
-- anchored to the map window so it follows wherever the minimap is put.
