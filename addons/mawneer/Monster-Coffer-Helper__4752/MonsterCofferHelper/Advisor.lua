-- The question this addon answers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
-- A Mystery Coffer is cheap but may hand you a shoulder you already own.
-- A curated coffer costs several times more and always hands you one you lack.
-- Because the goal is to collect every shoulder, each new piece is worth exactly
-- as much as any other, so the two offers can be compared on a single number:
-- keys spent per NEW shoulder.
--
--     mystery:  cost / P(the roll is something new)
--     curated:  cost                                  (P is 1 by definition)
--
-- Buy whichever number is lower. P is the part players cannot work out at a
-- glance, and it is what Model.lua goes and measures.
--
-- A Mystery Coffer rolls uniformly across every shoulder the vendor stocks,
-- collected or not. So with N shoulders on the shelf and M still missing,
-- P = M/N.

local function Harmonic(n)
    local sum = 0.0
    for i = 1, n do sum = sum + 1.0 / i end
    return sum
end

-- Expected keys to finish the vendor's whole shoulder pool.
--
-- With m of N still missing, each Mystery Coffer is a hit with probability m/N,
-- so one new piece costs mysteryCost * N / m on average. Summing that from
-- m = M down to 1 is a harmonic series -- the coupon collector's problem.
--
-- Mystery gets steadily worse as m shrinks while curated stays flat, so the
-- cheapest run is mystery early and curated for the tail. The switch point is
-- where the two per-piece costs meet: mysteryCost * N / m = curatedCost.
