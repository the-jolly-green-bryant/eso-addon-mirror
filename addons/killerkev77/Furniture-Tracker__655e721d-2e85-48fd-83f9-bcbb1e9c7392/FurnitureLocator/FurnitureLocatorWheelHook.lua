Furniture Locator - Quickslot Wheel entry (Slot 4)

Mirrors the exact pattern used by House Hotkey (a real, working, console
addon already installed and in daily use) for placing a custom entry on
a game utility wheel -- confirmed directly from its public source
(github.com/saranicole/HouseHotkey, HouseHotkey.lua HH.HookWheel).

Rather than needing LibRadialMenu or any new dependency, this hooks the
game's own UTILITY_WHEEL_GAMEPAD.menu.AddEntry function directly: when
the wheel tries to populate our chosen slot, we substitute our own
entry (name/icon/callback) instead of letting it show whatever would
normally go there. The hook chains through the original function for
every other slot, so it composes safely alongside other addons doing
the same thing (like House Hotkey itself).

Hardcoded to Quickslot Wheel (category 10, confirmed empirically --
HOTBAR_CATEGORY_QUICKSLOT_WHEEL was not a reliable constant to reference
by name), slot 4. No settings UI needed for a single fixed slot.

-- HOTBAR_CATEGORY_QUICKSLOT_WHEEL turned out not to be reliable to
-- reference by name -- SI_HOTBARCATEGORY10 (which it's paired with in
-- House Hotkey's source) is just a LOCALIZATION STRING ID, unrelated to
-- the actual numeric category value. Using the real value confirmed
-- directly from diagnostic output instead: opening the Quickslot Wheel
-- printed "category=10" for every slot.
local WHEEL_CATEGORY = 10
local WHEEL_SLOT_INDEX = 4 -- corrected: confirmed populated slots are 4, 5, 6, 8

-- Confirmed valid icon path (seen resolving correctly for a real item
-- during /flist testing earlier: "Khajiit End Table").
